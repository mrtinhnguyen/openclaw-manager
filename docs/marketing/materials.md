- **Audio:** High-energy synthwave track.

**Step 1: The Setup (0:15 - 0:45)**

- **Action:** Click "Get Started". Show the new "Crypto Setup" step.

**Step 2: Wallet & Security (0:45 - 1:10)**
- **Visual:** "Wallet Setup" screen. User toggles "Testnet Only" (emphasize this). Pastes a view-only address or generates a burner key.
- **Overlay Text:** "KEYS STORED LOCALLY ONLY"
- **Voiceover:** "Security first. We stick to Testnet for this demo. Your keys are encrypted locally on *your* machine. BlockClaw never sees them."

**Step 3: Installing Skills (1:10 - 1:40)**
- **Visual:** User browses the "Skill Store". Clicks "Install" on "Whale Watcher" and "Price Monitor".
- **Action:** Terminal shows background installation of the `bankr` skill.
- **Voiceover:** "Need new powers? Install skills like 'Whale Watcher' or 'Sniper' directly from GitHub. It's like an app store for your agent."

**Step 4: Chat Interaction (1:40 - 2:00)**
- **Visual:** Split screen: Telegram app on left, BlockClaw logs on right.
- **Action:** User types in Telegram: "Monitor ETH price and alert me if it drops below $2000." Bot replies instantly: "✅ Alert set for ETH < $2000."
- **Voiceover:** "Now you're live. Chat with your agent to set alerts, trade, or monitor nodes. Total control, zero monthly fees. Download BlockClaw today."
